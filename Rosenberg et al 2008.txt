Rosenberg et al 2008:
Computer-aided tomography was used to visualise and quantify biogenic structures (eg, burrows) in 3 dimensions.
Visualise and quanitfy biogenic structures & their volumes in sediment.
The volumes of 'active' biogenic structures, defined as connected to the sediment-water interface, were generally close to the interface with some secondary peaks.
Used core samples like we did.
CT scanned and digital information of each core was analysed to obtain the volume of water in tubes and burrows connected to SWI.  
Volume of alumina tracer and shells was computed when they occurred below SWI.
Computation of SWI provided a 3D interface is sediment, saved as a grey-level image and reconstructed as a 3D mesh file.
Better visualisation of objects in the structure.
